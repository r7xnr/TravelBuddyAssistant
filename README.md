# Travel Buddy - Android application:
An Android application that helps users locate their nearest points of interest, by implementing Google Maps and storing data on a cloud-based service provided by Firebase. It focuses on a simplistic approach towards interactions for users using the application. The application employs a user-based system, where users can add and upload places that they found. The locations of these places then become visible to other users, who can use the application to find interesting places of interest near to them. Currently, there has been no application or service available that stores a database of user-based pins for tourists. The released application runs on Android devices with an OS version 5.0 and above.
